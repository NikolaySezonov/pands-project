#### The overall objective

The aim of this project is to indroduce the author to data research, code and analysis on very limited scale. The output will be based on example of Iris data set created by botanist Robert A.Fisher in 1936.

#### Introduction

The data presented in this project has been investigated broadly and extensively across the globe, so there will be nothing new in it. The data set used in this project taken from "iris-data-set.csv" file. The name of the Python programme for this project is called "analyse.py". In order to run the code in the working folder ogf this project the following text should be used in the command line:

python analyse.py iris-data.csv

If the programme codes created/copied correctly by the author it should display some summaries of the data set content, output the summaries to csv files and will provide the options to user in plotting some of the figures.
