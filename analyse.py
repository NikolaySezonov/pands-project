# After conducting some research 4 modules that i most likely will use with this programme are as follows:
 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd 

# import matplotlib pyplot and pandasmodules abbreviated to plt and pd

iris_data = pd.read_csv("Iris-data-set.csv", header=None) 

# here I am setting up a variable for use in the program

iris_data.columns =["Sepal length (cm)","Sepal width (cm)","Petal length (cm)","Petal width (cm)","Species"]
# Adding headers to attributes (columns); source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28162530
